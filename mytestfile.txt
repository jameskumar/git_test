1.1 Got 15 minutes and want to learn Git?
Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes. It's a distributed version control system.

Our terminal prompt below is currently in a directory we decided to name "octobox". To initialize a Git repository here, type the following command:

git init


1.2 Checking the Status
Good job! As Git just told us, our "octobox" directory now has an empty repository in /.git/. The repository is a hidden directory where Git operates.

To save your progress as you go through this tutorial -- and earn a badge when you successfully complete it -- head over to create a free Code School account. We'll wait for you here.

Next up, let's type the git status command to see what the current state of our project is:

git status

1.3 Adding & Committing
I created a file called octocat.txt in the octobox repository for you (as you can see in the browser below).

You should run the git status command again to see how the repository status has changed:

git status
